Have you ever wondered why you prefer diagrams over lectures, or why you need to "do it yourself" to truly understand a concept? This interactive VAK Quiz helps you discover your dominant learning style using the Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic (VAK) model.

Visual (V): Learning by seeing (charts, images, and spatial layouts).
Auditory (A): Learning by hearing (discussions, verbal instructions, and sounds).
Kinesthetic (K): Learning by doing (physical movement, touch, and trial-and-error).
